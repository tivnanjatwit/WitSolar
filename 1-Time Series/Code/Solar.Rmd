# Because there appears to be a seasonal effect, we will use Sarima to take the seasonality into account

# Firstly, we will check the series for stationary by both visual inspection, as well as using the Ljung-Box test

acf(Solar_ts)

# Because the ACF plot shows a strong autocorrelation at lag 1, then decays, we can assume that there seems to be some non-stationary elements

pacf(Solar_ts)

# Because the PACF plot shows some significant lags, but little decay, we can also assume that there are non-stationary elements.

Box.test(Solar_ts, type = 'Ljung-Box')

# Because out p-value for the Ljung-Box test is significantly below .05 (2.52e-08), we reject the null hypothesis, further proving that there is some non-stationarity.
```



```{r}

adf.test(Solar_ts)

# Because the p-value for the Augmented Dickey Fuller test is smaller than .01, we reject the null hypothesis, determining that the series is stationary

# while this conflicts with the above acf, pacf, and ljung-box test, this may be due to trends in out time series object.
